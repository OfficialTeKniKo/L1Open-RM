## Goal/Intent
There are several goals or intentions that I plan to achieve with L1-Open. 
1) Correct a serious lack of continuity. L1O will be as close, to 9.2 content, as possible. This will be handled by cross referencing Korea, Japan and Taiwan databases and finding third-party information from the correct patch era. This will done with tools like archive.org, old fan-sites, etc.
2) Proper translations. The current ones are egregious at best. This is understandable based on the sheer amount of content but needs to be corrected by a human and not Google Translate.
3) Fixing bugs and exploits. Six years of MMO development has taught me a lot.
4) Correct and update the GM/Monitor tools. This will allow GMs to more easily and quickly monitor the server and player behaviours.
5) The name L1-Open was chosen with intent. Everyone has FREE access to all of the content here and updates for as long as I am able.

## Core Mechanics & Milestones
The core game mechanics need to be leveled out and balanced for today's content level. This will be based off references previously mentioned. This will also include all skills working as intended and as bug free as possible.
